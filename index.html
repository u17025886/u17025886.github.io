                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is DÃ©an Dobson. I am a 2nd year student at the University of Pretoria and I am 
                    currently studying BIT Information Science. <br><br>

                    This is my 2nd degree. I studied BCom Financial Sciences where I graduated in 2019. My main focus is to become a IT Auditor, 
                    so my journey is quite long,  but it will be worth it. <br><br>

                    My hobbies are reading and working out, but since my first experience with a coding language like HTML and CSS, I spend my time learning
                    my way around it an try to build some coding experience to be a better programmer.
